## Communication

The real world runs on communication. You can't skip meetings or miss deadlines
without letting the interested parties know. I expect the same out of you – talk
to me, let me know what adjustments or accommodations you need as they arise.
I'll be as flexible as I can be with deadlines as long as you talk to me in
advance. Afterwards, I feel the need to do those who were on time justice by
adding a penalty to those who are late.

I'm available via email and Slack for this class. I get notifications from Slack
more frequently than email.

### Feedback

I am still fairly new to teaching (it's not my first rodeo because it's my
third), and I want this class to be as useful to you as possible. To that end,
if you have feedback for me, whether that's something you want me to adjust,
start doing, or stop doing, please let me know, either by one of the above
communication channels or via
[this anonymous form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcu-u0LD5kB9rhOcA7E1ZCw6w05RlejzrFrRALEz7krkLjVQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## Use of AI

Please do not use AI to communicate with me. AI normally results in much more
verbose communication, and I prefer to get straight to the point. I have worked
enough with AI that I can generally tell, and I worry about situations like this
becoming more and more common:

### Office Hours

Office hours are available by appointment via Calendly. The link is bookmarked
in the Slack channel.

## Assignments

### Assignment Policy

Assignments can be turned in late for half credit. If you are concerned about
the deadline / have other things going on, sandbox-related or otherwise, please
let me know beforehand and we can figure out an equivalent or more
individualized deadline.

If you think you've done something equivalent already, reach out and let's talk
about it. I'd rather you focus on building, and give you credit where it's due.

### Assignment Descriptions

#### Vibe Coding (10pts / 10%)

**Due**: September 26th, 2025

Build out an app as far as you can within 2 hours using AI assistance,
including:

- Cursor
- Claude
- Gemini CLI
- ChatGPT

Submit a brief explanation of what you accomplished, what worked well, and what
didn't work well. We'll discuss in class. You're welcome to spend longer on this
if you want.

#### Feature (10pts / 10%)

**Due**: October 31st, 2025

Build a feature into your app that's more complex than a simple CRUD operation,
and the UI associated with it.

Examples of things that are not allowed:

- A form that creates something
- A button that creates or deletes something
- Clicking on something to edit a value
- A list of things

I'd like to see something more cohesive than this. Many of the above are trivial
to build with modern technologies and frameworks, and I want to see you be
creative with features that stretch beyond those.

Record and submit a demo (via YouTube, Loom, or mp4 file upload) of you going
through the user flow for this feature.

My goal with this assignment is to encourage you to build something more
complex, and solve the problems associated with building something that's not
easily abstracted away by a library or framework.

#### Deployed App (10pts / 10%)

Due: December 17th, 2025

Give me a URL I can use to visit at least a landing page for your site. This
should have at least one functional feature that requires a backend (waitlist,
demo app, log in).

#### HackThisSite (Extra Credit) (5pts / 5%)

Due: December 17th, 2025

Complete the Basic and JavaScript tracks on HackThisSite for 3 points each.
Submit a link to your profile. Leave a comment on your profile mentioning
Sandbox 05.

#### Check In 1 (60pts / 60%)

**Due**: December 17th, 2025

There are two options for this. With the other engineers on your team, make an
appointment during office hours, or submit a recording at your leisure. If
you're submitting a video, each member of your group should submit it.

Either way, we'll talk about these things:

- What have you built? Show off some key features of your final project, and any
  demos of ideas that didn't work out.
- What technical problems have you solved?
- What's the most important thing you've learned this semester?
- Are you proud of what you've built?

**Point Breakdown:**

- 24pts - Answering the Initial Questions
- 24pts - Demonstrating a Production Application
- 16pts - Answering any follow-up questions (this is done as part of the office
  hours meeting, or I'll follow up on Slack if there are any)

#### Participation (5pts / 5%)

Due: December 17th, 2025

Here are some options for participation:

- Give a Tech Talk (10 points)
- Ask questions in class (2.5 points)
- Come in for office hours outside of check-ins (2.5 points)
- Talk about news at the beginning of class (2 points)
- Submit topics to the Q&A sessions (2 points)
- Submit the participation activity in each class session (1 point)

This is available all semester, so there is no makeup for this assignment. This
is easier to do during class than out of it.

#### Attendance (5pts / 5%)

Due: December 17th, 2025

I'll pull this from Slido. You have two free absences before they start to count
against you.

## Honor Code

In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to
be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most
fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your own
work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a
failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the
university. Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming
Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an
effective learning and working environment. It is the university's expectation,
and every instructor's expectation in class, that each student will abide by all
Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847 if you have
questions about those standards.

## Preventing & Responding to Sexual Misconduct

_The health and well-being of students is of paramount importance at Brigham
Young University.  If you or someone you know has experienced sexual harassment
(including sexual violence), there are many resources available for assistance._

In accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, BYU prohibits
unlawful sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, against any
participant in its education programs or activities. The university also
prohibits sexual harassment by its personnel and students. Sexual harassment
occurs when

- a person is subjected to unwelcome sexual speech or conduct so severe,
  pervasive, and offensive that it effectively denies their ability to access
  any BYU education program or activity;
- any aid, benefit, or service of BYU is conditioned on a person’s participation
  in unwelcome sexual conduct; or
- a person suffers sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or
  stalking on the basis of sex.

University policy requires all faculty members to promptly report incidents of
sexual harassment that come to their attention in any way, including through
face-to-face conversations, a written class assignment or paper, class
discussion, email, text, or social media post. Incidents of sexual harassment
should be reported to the Title IX Coordinator
at [t9coordinator@byu.edu](mailto:t9coordinator@byu.edu) or (801) 422-8692 or
1085 WSC. Reports may also be submitted online
at [https://titleix.byu.edu/report](https://titleix.byu.edu/report) or
1-888-238-1062 (24-hours a day).

BYU offers confidential resources for those affected by sexual harassment,
including the university’s Sexual Assault Survivor Advocate, as well as a number
of non-confidential resources and services that may be helpful. Additional
information about Title IX, the
university’s [Sexual Harassment Policy](https://policy.byu.edu/view/index.php?p=155&s=s879),
reporting requirements, and resources can be found
at [http://titleix.byu.edu](http://titleix.byu.edu/) or by contacting the
university’s Title IX Coordinator.

## Student Disability

Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning
atmosphere that reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities. A
disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or
more major life activities. Whether an impairment is substantially limiting
depends on its nature and severity, its duration or expected duration, and its
permanent or expected permanent or long-term impact. Examples include vision or
hearing impairments, physical disabilities, chronic illnesses, emotional
disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety), learning disorders, and attention
disorders (e.g., ADHD). If you have a disability which impairs your ability to
complete this course successfully, please contact the University Accessibility
Center (UAC), 2170 WSC or 801-422-2767 to request a reasonable accommodation.
The UAC can also assess students for learning, attention, and emotional
concerns. If you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on the
basis of disability, please contact the Equal Opportunity Office at
801-422-5895, [eo_manager@byu.edu](mailto:eo_manager@byu.edu), or
visit [https://hrs.byu.edu/equal-opportunity](https://hrs.byu.edu/equal-opportunity) for
help.”
